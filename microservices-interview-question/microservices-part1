❓ Question:

When multiple microservices share a common domain model, sharing it through a common library can lead to tight coupling. To avoid this, follow these best practices:

✅ Answer:

1) Use Bounded Contexts (Domain-Driven Design)Each service should define its own version of the domain model that fits its context.

2) Share Contracts, Not CodeThis prevents ripple effects when one service changes its internal logic.Instead of sharing code via libraries, share contracts using OpenAPI/Swagger specifications, JSON Schemas, or Avro schemas for event-driven systems.

3) Use DTOs for CommunicationServices should exchange Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) over APIs or messages, not internal entities.Each service should map incoming DTOs to its internal model.

4) Schema Registry for EventsIn event-driven architectures, use a Schema Registry (like Confluent Schema Registry) to version and validate event schemas shared across services.

5) Versioning & Backward CompatibilityDesign APIs and events to be versioned and backward compatible so that services evolve independently.

6) Loose Coupling through API Gateways or Message BrokersLet services communicate through well-defined interfaces (REST, GraphQL, Kafka topics, etc.) instead of direct shared libraries.

⚠️ Summary:

Avoid coupling by sharing contracts, not code.

Keep domain models service-specific and communicate via versioned APIs or schema-defined events.
